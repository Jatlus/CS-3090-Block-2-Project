# CS-3090-Block-2-Project

Overview:
My program is a simple password strength checker written in python. The program will loop until a password containing a minimum of 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 digit, and 1 special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>) is entered. The password checking function itself simply uses regular expression operations and conditionals to make sure each type of character is included. Using VS Code, the program can be run 
by navigating to the "Run" dropdown menu in the top left of the window and selecting the "Run Without Debugging" option.

Warnings: 
This tool is for educational purposes only. It does not provide advanced password security measures like checking against breached passwords or enforcing complex requirements. The program only evaluates password complexity based on predefined rules and does not guarantee security.

Ethical Considerations:
This tool should not be used as a sole means of enforcing password security in sensitive systems. Users should be aware that password strength is not the only factor in securing accounts, other measures like two-factor authentication (2FA) are recommended. The program does not store passwords, but users should never enter real or sensitive passwords into untrusted software. Modifying this program to collect or store user passwords without consent would be unethical and potentially illegal. If someone modifies this tool to store passwords, they could deceive users into providing their credentials. If implemented in a system, it should never require users to enter existing passwords, as this could lead to phishing risks.
